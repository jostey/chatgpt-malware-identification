# chatgpt-malware-identification
In this repository I have created a simple example of a ChatGPT API request to query if given a source code is ChatGPT able to evaluate if it is malicious or malware.

## Explanation
In this simple example we see how the input is a keylogger in Python and is going to be analyzed if it is malware or not with ChatGPT capabilities, returned in a JSON. In order to return the output as we want we have given examples.

```
Q: Tell me if the following code is malicious. In JSON format
$$$ START CODE
print("Hello")
$$$ END CODE
A: {"malware": "0", "reason": "There is no indication that this code is malicious. It is a code in which the word "Hello" is printed."}
```

## Usage and output
You can view the help by running:
```
$ python main.py
```

### Example
```
$ python main.py --file example.c
```
```
[*] Analyzing file: example.c
[+] Malware detected!
[+] Reason: This is a malicious code. It is a keylogger that logs all keystrokes on the system and stores them in the /tmp/data file. It also opens an input device file and continuously listens for events, indicating it may be used to capture user interactions or steal information.
```

### v.0.2
@ns2switch
* Improved application output (`is_malware(input)`)
* Get names of imported DLL libraries and their corresponding symbols. (`get_imported_symbols(filename)`)
* Get the hash of a binary (may be useful in the future) (`get_hashes(filename)`)

### Installation
We need to use the Python openai library and have a usable OpenAI API Key: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys
```
openai.api_key = "API_KEY" 
```
#### Requirements
To install the dependencies you can install them with the following command:
```
$ pip install --upgrade openai
$ pip install json
```
or
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
